This is my first ever project in android & first cleint-server software!
After I read in the news about the ministry of transportation intention to expose web service regarding real time public transport locations (Known as SIRI protocol: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Interface_for_Real_Time_Information) I came up with idea to make an android app for this as project in Technion. The faculty staff accepted my request. This app behaves like the famous moovit well known app. In the time of requesting the permission to do the project - I never worked with android nor with client server SW, but I was determined to do so.
In order to succeed - We maintained `B2B` like connection with ministry of transportation.
This project demonstartes:
1. Client Server software. Where the server is apache tomact on linux, the cleint is Android and the DB is MySql on linux.
2. Self learning from zero of all above stuff and in the end working implementation.
3. In addition to building our web service, our web service "talked" to external web service under the SIRI protocol constraints.
